# 🌌 Predicting Hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs). The goal is to utilize data analysis and machine learning techniques to assess the potential threat posed by these celestial bodies.

## 📂 Contents
- **predicting-hazardous-neos-nearest-earth-objects.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the code, analysis, and visualizations related to the prediction of hazardous NEOs.

## 📊 Dataset
The project utilizes the **NASA Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) dataset**, which includes comprehensive data on NEOs from 1910 to 2024. The dataset is available for download from Kaggle: [NASA NEO Dataset (1910-2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivansher/nasa-nearest-earth-objects-1910-2024/data).

### Dataset Details:
- **File Name**: `nearest-earth-objects (1910-2024).csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains information about near-Earth objects, including their size, velocity, distance from Earth, and potential impact risks.
- **Key Features**:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for each NEO
  - **name**: Name of the NEO
  - **absolute_magnitude_h**: Absolute magnitude, which indicates size
  - **estimated_diameter_km**: Estimated diameter in kilometers
  - **is_potentially_hazardous_asteroid**: Boolean indicating if the NEO poses a potential hazard
  - **close_approach_date**: Date of closest approach to Earth
  - **miss_distance_km**: Distance from Earth at closest approach in kilometers
  - **relative_velocity_km_h**: Velocity relative to Earth in kilometers per hour

## 🛠️ Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
